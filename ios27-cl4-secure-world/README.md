# iOS 27 on Intel QEMU, SpringBoard, no Apple Silicon

**iOS 27 booting to SpringBoard on an ordinary Intel Mac under QEMU -- no Apple Silicon, no
device.** vphone needs Apple Silicon; this is the copyable path for the Intel Macs most people
already have. Definition of done, in order: (1) `/private/var` writable (fixup-mobile-tmp, no
EROFS); (2) SpringBoard stays up > 5 minutes with no 3-strike reboot; (3) guest pixels in the QEMU
window (IOMFB blit or VNC of the guest framebuffer -- the boot-log painter does not count).



> **About:** Booting iOS 27 to its real root filesystem on an Intel Mac via
> darwin-vm / qemu-sptm: SPTM/XNU, the secure world, and a lit DCP panel. WIP research.

Booting **iOS 27** (iPhone17,3, `t8140`/`d47ap`, build `24A5430a`) all the way to
its **real root filesystem** on an Intel Mac, with no Apple Silicon and no device,
using [`jprx/darwin-vm`](https://github.com/jprx/darwin-vm) and its `qemu-sptm` fork,
and lighting the **DCP display panel** with the live boot log along the way.

> **/private/var**, fixup-mobile-tmp with no EROFS) and goal 2 (SpringBoard up > 5 min, no 3-strike

## What this is

`darwin-vm` boots XNU under QEMU using Apple's real **SPTM** (Secure Page Table
Monitor) and **TXM** (Trusted Execution Monitor). This project pushes past a bare
kernel boot toward two goals:

- **A lit display.** Drive the **DCP** (Display CoProcessor) path far enough to paint
  a real panel (device id, boot progress, and the live kernel console) onto a
  640x1136 iPhone framebuffer.
- **A full OS.** Boot from the actual iOS root filesystem (not just the restore
  ramdisk), mount it, and reach `launchd`.

Both are working today. Full userspace boots (the SystemOS **Cryptex** dyld shared cache
is supplied and injected), the APFS root mounts read-write, `/private/var` is writable
(goal 1 done), and SpringBoard launches and stays up past 5 min (goal 2 done); the frontier is
goal 3, guest pixels (see [Status](#status)).

|---|---|
| ![scanout](shots/panel-scanout.png) | **Panel lit.** Emulated DCP scanout points the QEMU surface straight at guest framebuffer RAM. |
| ![boot screen](shots/panel-boot-screen.png) | **Graphical boot screen (full OS).** English progress ring driven by the real boot stage, over the live kernel console as hundreds of daemons launch. |
| ![console](shots/panel-ios-console.png) | **Live kernel console** rendered on the panel with a built-in VGA font. |
| ![restore console](shots/panel-root-shell.png) | **Restore ramdisk (Boot A).** The English restore console on the panel; panel and keyboard are wired to the guest UART. |

The **guarded world** is entered through GXF (`genter`/`gexit`); QEMU tracks it as
`env->currentg`. The three [core fixes](#the-three-qemu-guarded-domain-fixes) are all
gated on that flag so the normal-world XNU boot stays byte-for-byte unchanged.

## Two boot paths

```mermaid

    START([darwin-vm]) --> A{path?}

    A -->|"DARWIN_RTKIT + DARWIN_FB<br/>(restore ramdisk)"| BA["Boot A: Emulated DCP"]
    BA --> BA1["emulated DCP mailbox"]
    BA1 --> BA2["panel lit + live boot log"]
    BA2 --> BA3([interactive root shell])

    A -->|"bootkc.md0 + dtree_ios<br/>(real rootfs as md0)"| BB["Boot B: Full OS"]
    BB --> BB1["APFS mountroot ok"]
    BB1 --> BB2["APFS root mounted read-write"]
    BB2 --> BB3["launchd + daemons; SpringBoard launches"]
    BB3 --> BB4([/private/var writable, no EROFS - goal 1 done])

    classDef ok fill:#14351f,stroke:#3cb56c,color:#dff6e8;
    classDef blk fill:#3b1f1f,stroke:#b5533c,color:#f6e2e2;
    class BA2,BA3,BB1,BB2,BB3,BB4 ok;
```

- **Boot A** is the display bring-up: an emulated DCP RTKit endpoint lights the panel
  and renders the real boot log. This is the "screen" you can watch live.
- **Boot B** is the real OS: the decrypted rootfs is loaded as `md0` and mounted. A
  32-bit page-count truncation in XNU's md-device driver (`mdSize << 12` in `w`
  registers) capped the device at 1.36 GB; widening six instructions to 64-bit
  ([`bootkc.md0`](qemu-patches/)) fixed it and the **9.3 GB root now mounts**.

## The DCP display path

```mermaid

    K["IOMobileFramebuffer"] --> AFK["AFK ring transport"]
    AFK --> EP["DCPEndpoint / EPIC RPC"]
    EP -->|"swap_submit {iova,stride,w,h,fmt}"| RB["RBEP_RECV (apple_dcp.c)"]
    RB --> BLIT["read TX ring @ bfr_dva then blit"]
    BLIT --> FB["fb_base (guest RAM)"]
    FB --> SCAN["QEMU scanout surface"]
    SCAN --> PANEL(["panel"])

    classDef d fill:#14351f,stroke:#3cb56c,color:#dff6e8;
    classDef w fill:#35301f,stroke:#b59a3c,color:#f6efdf;
    class K,AFK,EP d;
    class RB,BLIT w;
```

Today the panel is painted **by the emulator** from the boot log (green = done, amber
= frontier). The next step for true pixels is decoding the iOS **IOMFB swap**
submissions in `apple_dcp.c` and blitting the guest surface directly, plus,
ultimately, an AGX GPU model for SpringBoard-level UI.

## Status

| Area | State |
|---|:--:|
| SPTM/TXM to XNU boot | done |
| Guarded-domain (SK/CL4) executes | done |
| DCP panel lit (scanout) | done |
| Real boot log on panel + progress | done |
| Interactive root shell on panel | done |
| Full rootfs boot to APFS `mountroot` | done |
| `md0` >4 GB truncation fix | done |
| `/sbin/launchd` starts | done |
| `libSystem` / dyld shared cache (Cryptex) | done |
| Full userspace: hundreds of daemons | done |
| **SpringBoard launches** | done |
| Root mounted read-write in-kernel at the apfs level | done |
| **Writable `/private/var` (fixup-mobile-tmp, no EROFS)** | done -- goal 1 |
| **SpringBoard stays up > 5 min, no 3-strike reboot** | done -- goal 2 |
| Guest pixels in the QEMU window | goal 3, next |
| IOMFB / DCP real-surface decode | later |
| AGX GPU (SpringBoard UI) | not emulated |

**Goal 1 is done: `/private/var` is writable.** fixup-mobile-tmp runs with no EROFS and the whole
boot log has zero "Read-only file system" errors (previously fixup-mobile-tmp, `lockdown.sock`,
`vpncontrol.sock` and `mDNSResponder` all failed EROFS). No panic; SpringBoard and backboardd launch.

Root cause and fix (two instructions, in the copy `bootkc.md0.rwlivefs`): every rootfs is born
read-only in the generic root-mount path (`vfs_rootmountalloc_internal` sets `MNT_RDONLY | MNT_ROOTFS`),
and `apfs_vfsop_mount` reads that flag at mount time and records read-only in its OWN private mount
state, so clearing the VFS flag after mount left every apfs transaction returning EROFS. The fix is
(1) clear `MNT_RDONLY` on the mount struct BEFORE the apfs mount worker runs, so apfs is asked for
read-write, and (2) bypass `apfs_mount_livefs`'s explicit refusal `can't mount root filesystem
writeable` (a single `tbnz` gate patched to always allow). This boot uses no sealed snapshot
("failed to find named root snapshot" then mounts the live volume), so apfs mounts the single volume
read-write and `/private/var` is writable with no separate Data volume required -- this supersedes the
earlier Data-volume / volume-group / mount-phase approach. The Cryptex is injected at
`/private/preboot/Cryptexes/OS` via [`inject_cryptex.sh`](scripts/inject_cryptex.sh). Full detail:
[`docs/STATE_darwinvm_boot.md`](docs/STATE_darwinvm_boot.md).

## The three QEMU guarded-domain fixes

All keyed on `env->currentg == 1`, so only the guarded world (SPTM/TXM/SK "CL4") is
affected and baseline XNU is untouched:

| # | File | Function | Change |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `target/arm/helper.c` | `fp_exception_el()` | guarded: FP/SIMD always accessible |
| 2 | `target/arm/ptw.c` | `get_phys_addr_disabled()` | guarded MMU-off memory = Normal WB |
| 3 | `target/arm/tcg/hflags.c` | `aprofile_require_alignment()` | guarded: no forced alignment |

They are captured in
[`qemu-patches/qemu-guarded-domain-fixes.patch`](qemu-patches/); the full set
(CL4 loader in `hw/arm/xnuboot_sptm.c`, the `-cl4` option, and the emulated DCP) is in
[`qemu-patches/qemu-sptm-cl4-all.patch`](qemu-patches/).

---

## Runtime knobs (`DARWIN_*`)

Environment toggles read by `hw/arm/darwin.c`:

| Knob | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `DARWIN_RTKIT=1` | bring up the emulated DCP RTKit mailbox (`0x412E00000`): **lights the panel** |
| `DARWIN_FB=1` | framebuffer + `boot_args.Video` + keyboard on the panel |
| `DARWIN_DISP=all\|<substr>` | back display register ranges (RAZ/WI); `dcp0-expert` fixes the DCP MMIO SEA |
| `DARWIN_AIC` / `DARWIN_DART` / `DARWIN_PMGR` | back the interrupt controller / DARTs / power manager |
| `DARWIN_DCPFW=<path>` | supply DCP firmware |
| `DARWIN_NOPAC=1` | runtime PAC-disable toggle (diagnostic) |

## Reproduce

```bash
# 1) build qemu-sptm with the patches
./rebuild-qemu.sh

# 2a) Boot A: lit panel + live log (restore ramdisk)
DARWIN_RTKIT=1 DARWIN_FB=1 ./run/view_screen.sh

# 2b) Boot B: full OS from the real rootfs (needs the Cryptex for userspace)
./scripts/inject_cryptex.sh <decrypted Cryptex1,SystemOS .dmg|.aea>
ROOTFS=firmware/rootfs_with_cryptex.dmg ./run/run_rootfs.sh
```

You supply the firmware. `run_rootfs.sh` defaults to the `bootkc.md0` kernelcache
(the one with the `md0` truncation fix) and the 20 GB `dtree_ios` device tree.
