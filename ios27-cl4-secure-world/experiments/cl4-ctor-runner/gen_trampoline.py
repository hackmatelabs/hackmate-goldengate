# gen_trampoline.py - assemble the CL4 __mod_init_func runner trampoline.
#
# Emits a small position-independent ARM64 (AArch64) code blob that, when
# executed in CL4's guarded EL1 context (MMU OFF, physical addressing), calls
# each of CL4's 11 __DATA,__mod_init_func constructors in array order and then
# branches to the real CL4 entrypoint.
#
# The blob is FULLY position-independent: it takes its four 64-bit parameters
# from a literal pool appended right after the code. The QEMU loader
# (hw/arm/xnuboot_sptm.c) is responsible for:
#   1. copying the `CODE` bytes into a scratch code page in guest RAM, and
#   2. writing the four 8-byte pool words (ARRAY, ARRAY_END, STACKTOP, ENTRY)
#      into the pool that immediately follows the code.
#
# Nothing here is hardcoded to a physical address - the loader supplies all
# addresses at boot from the values it already computes (rx_phys, entrypoint).
#
# Requires: keystone-engine (present in vphone-cli/.venv). Run:
#   source /Users/maliosdark/vphone-cli/.venv/bin/activate && python3 gen_trampoline.py

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The trampoline. Register plan (AArch64 AAPCS):
#   The 11 constructors are ordinary AAPCS functions: each one saves/restores
#   x19..x28 and x29/x30, so x19..x24 SURVIVE across every `blr`. We keep all
#   loop state in those callee-saved registers.
#
#   x19 = saved x0 (SPTM handoff pointer, tag2) - restored before entry
#   x20 = saved x1 (domain-descriptor pointer) - restored before entry
#   x21 = cursor into __mod_init_func (advances by 8)
#   x22 = end of the __mod_init_func array (ARRAY + 11*8)
#   x23 = scratch: current constructor physical pointer
#
# Entry state (set by SPTM's ERET into CL4, then diverted here by the hook):
#   x0 = handoff, x1 = descriptor (may be injected), SP = 0, PSTATE = guarded EL1h.
# CL4's real entry (0x...691d4f0) REQUIRES SP==0 (it branches on `cmp sp,#0`),
# so we save the incoming SP==0 implicitly by re-zeroing SP before the final br.
#
# The constructors DO push to the stack, so we install a scratch stack
# (STACKTOP) before the loop and tear it down (SP=0) afterwards.
#
# PAC: the trampoline itself uses only `blr`/`br` and never signs/authenticates
# its own return address, so it needs no PAC key. Each constructor's internal
# pacibsp/retab pair is self-balanced against its own SP frame and round-trips
# exactly as it already does everywhere else CL4 currently runs.
